	Changes:
		1.	Repackaged library in single nuget package, containing all versions and runtimes.
		2.	Added InstallID (GUID) to the AppData class, so it can be globally-accessible.
			This value can be used to determine the particular install instance of an application, as it should be set on deployment to a target machine.
		3.	Added Net 6 compiled target.
			This new target retains the same version number as the active Net 5 library.
		4.	Added helper method to the logging base class, that will return a caller's method name.
			This can be used to easily include method names in a log message without reflection.

History:
	Release:	v1.0.3
	Date:		20211215
	Build:		7
	Changes:
		1.	Added cStackTrace class to assembly.
			This class provides the ability to create a stack trace with frames that include filename and line number data, if a usable PDB file is present for an assembly.
			Or, for stack frames that don't have a usable PDB for their assembly, it will create a frame entry that has the module token and IL Offset.
			These latter two values maintain traceability to the source file for an assembly, in case the PDB is not shipped, or is the wrong version.
			The module token and IL Offset values can be used in a query of a PDB file, that's been coverted to XML, using the pdb2xml tool.
			Download the pdb2xml converter tool from MSDN: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=38449a42-6b7a-4e28-80ce-c55645ab1310&displaylang=en
