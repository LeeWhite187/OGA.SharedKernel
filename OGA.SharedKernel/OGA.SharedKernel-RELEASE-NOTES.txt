Type:			Project Release Notes
For:			Shared Kernel Library
Date:			20230217
Description:	This is the lowest layer library of standardized classes used by all other libraries.
				This library is composed of classes and elements taken fromn the common libraries, to serve as
				a bottom layer that is thin enough to be used by the Domain Base libraries.
				This allows any assembly in a process to use this library without pollution.
				Specifically, this library was put together to be the exclusive reference for any Domain library,
				allowing the domain logic to be free of other assembly references.
				This library includes the following classes and elements that can be consumed:
					Date Time Utility extension class for truncating timestamps as needed for compatibility across backends.
					Some attribute classes used to decorate entities and other classes.
					App Path class, for global acesss to app path data within a runtime.
					Build Data class, for global acesss to process build data within a runtime.
					A set of base exceptions and business exceptions that can be used by all project types.
					A logging base to make logging accessible at the lowest layer of a project, the domain entity layer.
					The App Data class was moved here, so that all layers of a process can access it.
					The Stacktrace class is here, which can be used to provide additional callsite metadata
					for logging diagnostic messages, when a PDB is not present with process binaries.
					The Pagination Filter class is here, which allows result pagination to occur at the domain layer.
					Service interfaces, are here, such as the URI service.
					Global constants class for exposing company and application metadata to the entire process stack.
					A Return Data class, that allows a method to return a result and a message without a REF or OUT argument.

----------------------------------------
Pending Changes:
	Include in next release version...
		1.	Revised namespaces across project to make it: OGA.SharedKernel, instead of: OGA_SharedKernel
----------------------------------------
Current:
	Release:	v1.3.1
	Date:		20220930
	Build:		13
	Changes:
		1.	Revised namespaces across project to make it: OGA.SharedKernel, instead of: OGA_SharedKernel
		2.	Added additional compile target for NET framework v4.7.

	Release:	v1.3.0
	Date:		20220929
	Build:		12
	Changes:
		1.	Revised namespaces across project to make it: OGA.SharedKernel, instead of: OGA_SharedKernel

	Release:	v1.2.2
	Date:		20220927
	Build:		11
	Changes:
		1.	Repackaged library in single nuget package, containing all versions and runtimes.

	Release:	v1.2.1
	Date:		20220927
	Build:		11
	Changes:
		1.	Repackaged library in single nuget package, containing all versions and runtimes.
		2.	Added InstallID (GUID) to the AppData class, so it can be globally-accessible.
			This value can be used to determine the particular install instance of an application, as it should be set on deployment to a target machine.
		3.	Added Net 6 compiled target.
			This new target retains the same version number as the active Net 5 library.
		4.	Added helper method to the logging base class, that will return a caller's method name.
			This can be used to easily include method names in a log message without reflection.

	Release:	v1.2.0

	Release:	v1.1.1
	Date:		20220625
	Build:		9
	Changes:
		1.	Added InstallID (GUID) to the AppData class, so it can be globally-accessible.
			This value can be used to determine the particular install instance of an application, as it should be set on deployment to a target machine.
		2.	Added Net 6 compiled target.
			This new target retains the same version number as the active Net 5 library.
		3.	Created the NET 6 library target, and had to recompile the library to fix a preprocessor directive issue.

History:
	Release:	v1.0.3
	Date:		20211215
	Build:		7
	Changes:
		1.	Added cStackTrace class to assembly.
			This class provides the ability to create a stack trace with frames that include filename and line number data, if a usable PDB file is present for an assembly.
			Or, for stack frames that don't have a usable PDB for their assembly, it will create a frame entry that has the module token and IL Offset.
			These latter two values maintain traceability to the source file for an assembly, in case the PDB is not shipped, or is the wrong version.
			The module token and IL Offset values can be used in a query of a PDB file, that's been coverted to XML, using the pdb2xml tool.
			Download the pdb2xml converter tool from MSDN: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=38449a42-6b7a-4e28-80ce-c55645ab1310&displaylang=en
